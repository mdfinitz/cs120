    <h2>Most Recent Trip</h2>
    <p>I did a four day ski trip at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this past March. The visibility was pretty low for
    most of the trip, but we got plenty of fresh snow through out the week! I would recommend the Hoback trails
    to the left of Rendezvous Mountain for anyone planning to do a ski trip at Jackson Hole in the future.
    We were also able to see two moose at the base of the mountain on two separate occasions!

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <a href="http://www.felipesboston.com/" target="_blank">Felipe's Mexican Taqueria</a> has been my
    favorite restuarant ever since I moved to Boston. The serving sizes are excellent
    and you never have to wait long in line to get a burrito or bowl. I prefer the
    burrito bowl with Tinga De Pollo and all of the toppings!

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    <img src="../images/pasta.jpg">
    My favorite meal, without a doubt, would be home made pasta. I prefer to make the dough by mixing the flour and eggs by hand using the "volcano technique". I usually serve it with a heavier type of red sauce, such as Puttanesca. Finally, I like to serve a protein on the side such as roasted chicken.
