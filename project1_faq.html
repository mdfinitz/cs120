        <div>
            <p>Rhythmic Recursion is a New England-based band that loops logic into groove, fusing computer science concepts with dynamic soundscapes. Born from late-night code jams and open mic nights in Boston's techie underground, the group layers electronic beats, live instruments, and algorithmic patterns to create a sound that's both cerebral and soulful. We pride ourselves on creating music that blends ageless music genres, lyrical nods to recursion, and the chaos of debugging life.</p>
            <p>From Tufts dorm rooms to festivals all over New England, Rhythmic Recursion has been steadily building a following among programmers, engineers, and anyone who knows that good rhythm is all about elegant repetition. Whether you're refactoring your life or just vibing on a loop, this band hits the right frequency.</p>

                    <div class="artist-job">Lead Singer</div>
                    <div>Lexi grew up in Boston, raised on a mix of classic rock, soul, and indie electronica. She majored in Human-Computer Interaction at Tufts with a minor in Music Education. Her lyrics often explore themes of recursion, relationships, and digital disconnection — all delivered with raw emotional precision.</div>

                    <div>Quinn Trace began as a signal processing major at Tufts, where he fell in love with the analog warmth of bass guitars and the digital depth of waveforms. Known for his ability to lock into complex time signatures while grounding the band's sound, Quinn builds bass lines like a nested function—clean, purposeful, and essential to execution.</div>

                    <div class="artist-job">Lead Guitar</div>
                    <div>Theo is a self-taught guitarist who got his start playing in music clubs while studying software engineering at Tufts. His technical background shapes his approach to composition — he thinks of riffs as algorithms, structured and evolving with complexity.</div>

                    <div>Mira got her start drumming in metal bands while tinkering with electronics. A dual degree in Computer Engineering and Audio Design led her to design her hybrid kit — combining acoustic drums with pressure-sensitive MIDI pads and custom triggers.</div>

                    <div>Renn studied music theory and machine learning at Tufts. He programs his own virtual instruments, designing soundscapes that blur the line between analog and algorithm. Every Rhythmic Recursion album features at least one track powered by his custom software synths.</div>
